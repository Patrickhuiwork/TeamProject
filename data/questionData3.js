      options: ['A', 'B'],
      imageSrc: '/illustrations/wood moisture content and thickness.svg',
      answer: 'A',
      explanation: "Moisture content is the primary factor in how fast something burns, as water's high heat capacity absorbs energy and prevents ignition, and decreasing moisture content makes material more susceptible to heat and quicker to burn.",

      question: 'Which of the following is a common factor that contributes to the ignition and spread of ordinary fires?',
      questionoptions: 'A: Low oxygen levels',
      questionoptions1: 'B: Low wind speeds',
      options: ['A', 'B'],
      imageSrc: '/illustrations/rubber gas.svg',
      answer: 'A',
      explanation: 'Oxygen is a crucial element in the process of combustion, which is the chemical reaction that occurs when a fuel source reacts with oxygen and produces heat and light.When the oxygen level is low, the fire may burn less intensely or even go out, but when the oxygen level is high, it can cause the fire to spread more rapidly.
