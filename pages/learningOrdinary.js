            <p>An ordinary fire, also known as a Class A fire, is a fire that involves ordinary combustibles such as wood, paper, or cloth. These types of fires typically occur in homes, offices, and other structures and can be caused by a variety of factors such as faulty wiring, smoking materials, and cooking equipment. Class A fires can usually be extinguished with water or a fire extinguisher that is rated for Class A fires. It is important to take precautions to prevent these types of fires and to have an emergency plan in place in case of a fire emergency.</p>

                    <li>Use water: If the fire is small and contained to a specific area, you can try to put it out by using water. Use a bucket or a hose to spray water directly onto the flames, making sure to stand at a safe distance.</li>
                    <li>
                    Smother the fire: If water is not effective or not available, try smothering the fire with a fire blanket or any other non-flammable material.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    Use a fire extinguisher: If the fire is still not out, use a Class A fire extinguisher to put out the flames. Aim the extinguisher at the base of the fire and sweep back and forth until the fire is completely extinguished.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    Evacuate the building and call the fire department: If the fire is too large or the flames cannot be extinguished quickly, evacuate the building immediately and call the fire department.

            <p>
            Remember, moisture content is the primary factor in how fast something burns, as water's high heat capacity absorbs energy and prevents ignition, and decreasing moisture content makes material more susceptible to heat and quicker to burn. Taking precautions such as proper storage of flammable materials and regular maintenance of smoke detectors greatly reduces the risk of a Class A fire starting in the first place. Additionally, make sure to properly educate yourself and others on the proper use of fire extinguishers and when to call for professional help.
