            <p>A grease fire is a type of fire that occurs when oil or grease, often used for cooking, overheats and catches fire. Grease fires can spread quickly and are extremely dangerous, as they can easily ignite nearby flammable materials and cause extensive damage. They can also cause severe burns and injuries if not handled properly. It is important to take precautions to prevent grease fires and know how to safely extinguish them if they do occur. </p>

            <p>Do not use water: Never use water to put out a grease fire, as water can cause the fire to spread and make the situation worse.</p>

                    <li>Turn off the heat source: The first step in dealing with a grease fire is to turn off the heat source to eliminate the source of the fire. This will help prevent the fire from spreading and minimize the risk of injury.</li>
                    <li>
                    Cover the pan with a lid or baking sheet: If the fire is small and contained to the pan, try covering the pan with a lid or baking sheet to smother the flames. Do not use a glass lid, as it may shatter due to the heat.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    Use baking soda or a Class K fire extinguisher: Class K fire extinguishers contain a special extinguishing agent that is effective in smothering fires fueled by cooking oils and fats, and can cool down the high temperatures associated with grease fires to prevent re-ignition. Alternatively, Baking soda is better than water for extinguishing grease fires, as water can cause the fire to spread. Baking soda releases carbon dioxide that smothers the fire
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    Evacuate the building and call the fire department: If the fire is too large or the flames cannot be extinguished quickly, evacuate the building immediately and call the fire department.
                    </li>
                  </ol>

              )}
            </div>

            <p>Remember, regularly cleaning the hood and stove to remove buildup greatly reduces the risk of a grease fire starting in the first place. In addition, it's important to have a Class K fire extinguisher on hand in your kitchen to quickly and safely extinguish a grease fire.</p>
